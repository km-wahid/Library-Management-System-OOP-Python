# Library Management System

A simple Library Management System implemented in Python that allows users to view available books, borrow books, and return borrowed books. The system is designed using object-oriented programming principles with two main classes:

- **Book**: Represents a book with attributes like `book_id`, `title`, `author`, and `availability`.
- **Library**: Manages a collection of books and offers functionality to borrow, return, and view book details.

## Features

1. **View All Books**: Displays a list of all books available in the library along with their details (ID, title, author, availability).
2. **Borrow a Book**: Allows a user to borrow a book by entering its ID, provided the book is available.
3. **Return a Book**: Allows a user to return a borrowed book by entering its ID.
4. **Exit**: Closes the program.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Python file `library_management_system.py` in your preferred editor.
3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python library_management_system.py
